# Password Generator by emilyresch
This was my first assignment in bootcamp using Javascript.

## Description
This is a password generator that allows users to choose the length and the types of characters they would like in their secure password.

## Use
The user is alerted that they will be able to use this website to generate a secure new password for themselves. Through a series of alert prompts, the user can decide the length, if they want upper/lowercase letters, special characters, and/or numbers in their new password. Based on their answers, they will be shown their shiny new password in the password box on the page.
